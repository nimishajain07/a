<p>An experiment is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a hypothesis. Experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated. Experiments vary greatly in goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results. There also exists natural experimental studies.Experiment is the world's largest open platform for funding science research. Share in the moment of discovery and help enable innovation. Make science go fast.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>This is an example of one of my experiments 
    Indregients are - 
1) Small paper cups, bowl or an ice cube tray
2)Glass of water
3)String (yarn or kite sting works great)
4)Small stick
5)Salt
    Let's Do
    1)Fill the cup or tray up with water and place it in the freezer.  You can also use ice cubes from your freezer and skip this step.
    2)When the water is frozen, remove the ice from the cup or tray.
    3)Put the ice in the glass or bowl of water. The cube will bob up and down in the water and then float on the top.
    4)Place one end of the string from the fishing pole on top of the ice cube and sprinkle salt on the ice where the string is touching. Watch as the water melts slightly and refreezes.
    5)After about 10 seconds, carefully lift the ice cube out of the water with the fishing pole. You caught a fish (ice)!</p>
